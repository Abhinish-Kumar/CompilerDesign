## Introduction to Compilers

#### 1. Why Compilers Are Important
 Translation of High-Level Code: Compilers convert high-level programming languages (like Python, Java, or C++) into machine code that computers can understand and execute. This translation enables developers to write complex programs without needing to know the intricate details of the computer's hardware.
 
#### 2. The Future of Compilers 
The future of compilers is evolving alongside advancements in technology. like Support for New Programming Paradigms.

#### 3. The Past of Compilers 
The history of compilers is rich and significan
In the early days of computing, programs were written in assembly language, which is a low-level representation of machine code. This was time-consuming and prone to errors.
The invention of high-level programming languages in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Fortran and COBOL, led to the creation of the first compilers. These early compilers translated high-level code into machine code, revolutionizing software development.
Over the years, compiler technology has advanced significantly, with a focus on optimization techniques to improve code performance and efficiency.


### Why Study Compilers?
Studying compilers is essential for understanding the foundational concepts of computer science and software development. || Insight into Language Design||Improved Debugging Skills||Optimization Techniques


Technology Trends 
1. Moore's law is running out of steam:-As Moore's Law slows, compilers become crucial for maximizing software performance on existing hardware.
2. Programming languages abstractions are becoming higher level:- Programming languages are becoming more user-friendly and powerful, with compilers bridging the gap to hardware, enabling developers to concentrate on problem-solving.

Because of compiler you not need to write low languages like assembly languages 


## Moore's Law
Its not a law but a kind of prediction made by Moore's who is the cofounder of INTEL 

1. Gondon Moore , co-founder of intel(a company for semiconductors)
2. He made this prediction in 1965 :- "Number of integrated components will double every year for at least the next decade"  it is exponential growth in processing chip
3. In 1975 :- revised to "double every two years"
4. In 2015 :- revised to "double every speed saturated in 2000s.(processing power of computer was increasing exponentially year by year) But there is a physical limits to make transistors small.

## Physical Limits to transistor scaling

Source-to-drain leakage 
Limited gate material 
Limited options for transistor material(silicon)

safe to assume that "all exponentials come to an end"
Then logical CPUS or phycal cpus with cors and threads , rise with the concept of multi core computing 


## Architectural Innovations Necessitated 
Single core CPU ---> Multi-core CPU 
Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) eg: GPUs
Complex Instruction Sets eg:- X86-64SSE,ARM SVE(scalable vector extention) parallel computation
